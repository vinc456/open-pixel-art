Installing Git
What is git?
Git is a type of tool called version control software. Version control software allows you to collaborate with other developers by maintaining a list of all the changes your codebase has undergone.

Each of the changes is stored in git as a snapshot of your code at a certain point in time. Git calls these snapshots "commits". The full list of commits is shared on your local computer and a remote server like GitHub. Now, anyone with permission can access the list of code changes using git.

We'll make our first local commit once we get to the center of the maze!

Follow git's instructions to install
Git is a command line tool, which means you'll need to be familiar with how to open something like Terminal on MacOS or PowerShell on Windows.

There are other tools, like GitHub Desktop, that wrap command line git in a graphical user interface. This can be helpful and often powerful enough for most use cases!

This mission will require, and walk through the usage of command line git. The git website maintains a list of instructions for how to install git on various different operating systems. Follow these instructions!

If the command line version doesn't click with you, give GitHub Desktop a try after this mission!

Hack away!
Follow the official git installation instructions. Once you've done that, run the following command in your terminal to ensure git is installed correctly.

git --version
If git is installed correctly, you should see text that looks like this:

git version 2.22.0
Once you've verified you have git installed locally, click HACK.
