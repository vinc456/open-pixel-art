Its Tine to Do This
What is a fork?
A fork is your own personal copy of someone else's repository. You're free to make whatever changes you want without affecting the other person's work. This can be useful if you need to tweak a project for your own usage. More commonly, it's used so you can propose changes to someone else's project.

A word of warning, some projects are licensed in a way that prevents you from doing certain things! GitHub maintains some resources to help you understand licensing.

Open Pixel Art
The repository we're going to fork is one we created especially for this mission. It is called Open Pixel Art and you can view the project online. Every pixel on this web page was placed by someone completing this course. Soon, you'll be learning how to add your very own pixel!

It all starts with a fork
First we need to learn how to create a fork! GitHub tries to keep this process straightforward, and they maintain documentation that is kept up to date here.

GitHub lists their own example repository for you to fork, but you should fork our Open Pixel Art repository instead to complete this mission.

Now you know what a fork is, what we're forking, and how to fork it. So fork it! Once you've created your own fork of the Open Pixel Art repository click the HACK button. Be sure your fork is named open-pixel-art.
