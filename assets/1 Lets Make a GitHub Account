Lets Make a GitHub Account
What is GitHub?
GitHub is a website that hosts open source code on the internet so that developers around the world can collaborate on it remotely. It runs on a technology for code sharing called git that we will learn a little about in later objectives.

GitHub Signup Process
Follow the GitHub sign up process to create a new user account. You will only need a free plan to complete this objective, and as long as you're working on open source software you'll only ever need the free plan!

After you create your account, you should receive an email asking you to validate your email address. Be sure to follow those instructions so that you can start using your GitHub account!

Hack this Barrier
Now that you have a validated GitHub user account, enter the username you chose into the field on the right and press HACK!
