Configuring Git
How do I configure?
Git's global configuration file can be edited using the command git config in your terminal. There are a lot of different options that let you customize git to your particular workflow.

We're only going to need to set two options to use git with GitHub in this mission. Those two settings are our global user name and email. The following commands will set these for us. We're using the --global flag so that we use this same name and email for every git project.

Show me the commands
Before running this command, replace John Doe with your name. Make sure to leave the quotes!

git config --global user.name "John Doe"
Before running this command, replace johndoe@example.com with your registered GitHub email address.

git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
Verify!
To ensure you've configured everything correctly, run the following command:

git config --list
You should see your user.name and user.email set with the correct values!
